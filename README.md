# Water Bucket Challenge    

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 15.1.6.

Build an application that solves the Water Jug Riddle for dynamic inputs (X, Y, Z). 
The simulation should have a UI (if SPA) to display state changes 
for each state for each jug (Empty, Full or Partially Full).
You have an X-gallon and a Y-gallon jug that you can fill from a lake.
(Assume lake has unlimited amount of water.) 
By using only an X-gallon and Y-gallon jug (no third jug), measure Z gallons of water.
